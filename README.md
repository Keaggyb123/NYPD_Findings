# New York Police Department Complaint Analysis
### Hypothesis Test
* Null Hypothesis: White police officer complaint cases and Non-white police officer complaint cases are equally as likely to go against the police officer.

* Alternative Hypothesis: Non-white police officer complaintant cases are more likely to go against the police officer than white police officer cases.

* Test Statistic: 0.015: The normalized difference in percent of outcomes that are substantiated between White and Non-white officers.

* Result: P-value: 0.001 --> This leads us to believe that Non-white officer complaint case results and White officer complaint cases do not come from the same distribution, and could mean that they are handled differently.
